// Announces a Starlink-side outage in a plain browser tab: the dish is powered
// and reachable, and its pings to the point of presence are not coming back.
//
// Only in a tab. On the desktop the recorder in the main process watches the
// same drop rate and announces it whether or not a window exists, so this would
// be a second voice saying the same thing — see hostAnnouncesAlerts.
//
// Two things it deliberately does NOT announce:
//
// Losing contact with the dish. That is an alert about this machine's own reach
// (`dishUnreachable`), and useDeviceAlerts owns every alert-shaped notification
// so exactly one place decides what is worth interrupting someone for.
//
// Outages the dish logged in its own history. Those are the same events this
// already reports live, arriving a second time by a slower route — the log is
// what fills the History tab, not a second reason to interrupt someone. It used
// to notify from both, which meant one outage produced two notifications with
// two different wordings, and needed a freshness window and a first-observation
// skip to stop a full ring buffer announcing itself at startup. All of that was
// the cost of the second path, not of the problem.
