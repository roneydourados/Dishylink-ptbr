// Desktop notifications for alerts, opt-in via the alerts panel.
//
// Two transports, one interface. In the desktop app the host posts them from the
// main process; in a browser tab the web Notification API does. They are kept
// behind one door because everything upstream — useDeviceAlerts, the outage
// notifications — should only have to know that a notification was requested.
//
// Where the state lives differs, and that is what shapes this file. A host with
// its own always-on process owns it: the desktop main process and the extension's
// background worker each announce alerts with no window open, so a preference
// this window kept to itself would be unreadable exactly when it mattered. This
// module holds what such a host last reported and is told when that changes; the
// controls read it synchronously and re-render on the change. A plain browser tab
// has no such process, and there this module's own reading of localStorage and
// the page's permission is the whole of it.
//
// Permission also differs, and only the tab has any. A sandboxed renderer on the
// app:// origin never reaches `Notification.permission === "granted"`, so the
// desktop app asks the OS through its host instead and learns the answer the only
// way macOS gives it: by posting one and seeing whether it arrived. The OS accepts
// a request from an app it holds no notification registration for and drops it
// silently, so an attempt is the only test. An unsigned dev run always fails it —
// notifications land in the packaged, signed app — and the reason is reported
// beside the control rather than left as a switch that appears to do nothing.
