// One choice shared by both surfaces that draw a dome — the dashboard card and
// the full sky view — because they are the same dome seen at two sizes, and
// having one trimmed while the other is not reads as a bug rather than a
// setting. Either surface can set it, and both follow.

// Kept here rather than in React state for the same reason: the two live in
// different parts of the tree and would otherwise need the flag threaded through
// everything between them.
